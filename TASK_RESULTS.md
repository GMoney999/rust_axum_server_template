# TASK_RESULTS

Date: 2025-08-12

Progress log for TASK.md (test authoring):

1) Scope review and surface mapping
- Confirmed routes: /health, /todos (GET, POST) in src/models/server.rs and src/routes/routes.rs.
- Middleware stack: trace, normalize-path, request-id; optional CORS from config; admin bearer applied only in main.rs.
- Config knobs: request-id header name, timeout, CORS policy.
- Startup runs migrations.

2) Preflight fix (from PREREQUISITES)
- Adjusted create_todo to use DB-assigned BIGSERIAL id and RETURNING row.

3) Test scaffolding plan
- Unit tests co-located in src/routes/routes.rs under cfg(test).
- Component tests in tests/middleware.rs (request-id, normalize-path, CORS).
- Integration tests in tests/healthcheck.rs and tests/todos_flow.rs using spawn helpers.
- DB helpers in tests/common/{mod.rs,db.rs} supporting TEST_DATABASE_URL, migrations.

4) Implementation steps
- Added unit tests for health and todos handler behaviors, including error mapping.
- Added middleware tests verifying header presence, path normalization, and CORS behavior.
- Added integration tests: e2e health, todos create/list flow, malformed body handling, and DB-unavailable behavior.
- Added DB utilities for transaction-per-test and ephemeral DB (choose one at runtime via env).

5) How to run
- cargo test --all-features
- For DB tests, set TEST_DATABASE_URL pointing at a Postgres server; migrations run automatically in test helpers.

Notes
- Request-id default header is x-request-id per ServerConfig; tests also cover custom header via env.
- Admin bearer layer is not applied by default in tests; separate targeted tests can add it explicitly if desired.
